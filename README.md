# Panel Data Analysis in Innovation
Innovation is a key driver of economic growth and a prime source of competition in the global marketplace, and it can be influenced by lots of factors including investment of research and development (R&D) and the number of all kinds of patents.

In this project, panel data regression is applied to investigate the correlation between science and technology (S&T) indicators and exports from a quantitative perspective. 

Taking into consideration that panel data analysis has a high requirement for data integrity, we use the random forest in R to fill in variables with less than 20% missing data and delete those variables with more than 20% missing value. 

Our overall analysis can be divided into three parts. The first part use exports of three industries, aerospace, computer, and pharmaceutical as dependent variables. By using  industry-specific independent variables, three regressions are built. Then the second part is based on the dataset focus on patent and expenditure of each sector. And in the final part we analysis the international relationship between patent and export. All the analysis process was conducted by R, too.
